	# This class was created to wrap and ease the use of the example in
	# this link: https://sensirion.github.io/python-i2c-sht/quickstart.html
	# It is to be used to control one SHT3x [1] sensor connected to a SEK
	# Sensor Bridge [2]. For this to work, connect the sensor to the "port 1"
	# in the sensor bridge and then the sensor bridge with the USB to the
	# computer.
